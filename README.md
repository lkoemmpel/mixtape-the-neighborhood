# Mixtape the neighborhood
Not sure what live music to go hear on a Friday night? Want to get to know the artists playing live in your neighborhood but not sure where to start?

This is my personal coding project where I web scrape lists of locally performing artists into a list and then automatically generate a Spotify playlist of their top songs. 

# Running the script locally
The script can be run locally for The Lilypad (local music venue in Inman Square Cambridge, MA) via `python3 web_scraping_playlist.py`.
